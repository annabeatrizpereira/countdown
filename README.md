<h2>Description</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This is a project using JavaScript to create a countdown timer to launch a website that's still in development.</li>
  <li>There's also a modal so the visitor can subscribe to know more about what's being prepared.</li>
  <li>To create a countdown is one of the first steps to understand more about JavaScript. That's why I made it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies</h2>
<p>First of all, the design was made by the Rocketseat team,  <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/BHW1yF77yNLhI23INp3vEg/DD-%2F-Countdown-(Copy)?node-id=0%3A1">here's the link on Figma to access it.</a> (you'll need to create an account - but it's free!)</p>
<p>I made some changes in the layout creating a modal, since it was not made available by Rocketseat team.</p>

<h2>How can I use it?</h2>
<p>It's really simple!</p>
<ol>

</ol>

  ```
  module.exports = {
    content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"],
    theme: {
      extend: {
        colors: {
          'blue': '#6C63FF',
        }
      },

      fontFamily: {
        'poppins': 'Poppins, sans-serif',
      }
    },
    plugins: [],
  }
  ```
